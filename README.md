# Description
danaXa is an AI holding company which provides computer vision solutions and use machine learning for human/object detection and tracking. On July 30, 2020, I was assigned to improve the user experience of dlabel, An annotation tool for video and image datasets to be used for deep learning. In the first section, I reviewed potential design bugs, which might lead to a bad user experience. Some flaws have been identified, and solutions have been offered afterward. In addition, some suggestions have been made in order to increase the usability of the product.
